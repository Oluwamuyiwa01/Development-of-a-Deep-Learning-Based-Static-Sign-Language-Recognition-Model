# Development-of-a-Deep-Learning-Based-Static-Sign-Language-Recognition-Model
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing static sign language gestures. It was developed as my undergraduate thesis in Computer Science at Federal University Lokoja, Nigeria.
##Overview
This project presents a deep learning-based static sign language recognition model designed to assist the deaf and hard-of-hearing in basic communication. The system captures and classifies static hand gestures using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a self-generated dataset. Key components include a data acquisition module using a webcam, preprocessing techniques for noise reduction and segmentation, feature extraction using CNNs, and model testing for performance tuning. The model can serve as both an educational tool and a foundational communication aid.
